abstract = {In this study, measurements of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) at 760 nm (F760) are combined with hyperspectral reflectance (R) measurements collected in the field over agricultural crops in order to better understand the fluorescence (ChlF) signal of the vegetation. The ‘Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes' (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer and enzyme kinetics of photosynthesis with turbulent heat exchange in vegetation canopies, was partly inverted to obtain model parameters from R taken over healthy (unstressed) crops during the growing season. Reflectance spectra between 400 and 900 nm obtained at midday on different days in the growing season were used to obtain pigment concentrations, leaf area index and leaf inclination. These parameters were then used to simulate diurnal cycles of half-hourly ChlF spectra, using measured weather variables as input. Three scenarios were simulated: (i) a constant emission efficiency of ChlF (at the photosystem level), (ii) a variable emission efficiency calculated per half hour with an electron transport, photosynthesis and ChlF model for the photosystem, and (iii) a constant emission efficiency that was set to a theoretical maximum value for fully blocked photochemical electron transport of photosystem II and minimal non-photochemical quenching. The simulations of the first two scenarios were compared to ChlF retrieved from field measurements in the O2-A band with the spectral fitting method in unstressed rice and alfalfa. This comparison and a sensitivity analysis showed that SCOPE reproduces most of the seasonal variability of SIF after tuning to R even if the ChlF emission efficiency is kept constant, and F760values are mostly determined by chlorophyll content, dry matter, senescent material and leaf area and leaf inclination, whereas leaf water and carotenoid content had small effects. Diurnal variations in the ChlF emission efficiency at photosystem level were small in these crops. The simulations of the third scenario were compared to measurements of grass that was treated chemically to block electron transport and to provoke maximum ChlF. This comparison showed that the observed increase in F760can indeed be explained by a change in the ChlF emission efficiency at the photosystem level. It is concluded that hyperspectral reflectance and the ChlF signal together can reveal both the dynamics of vegetation structure and functioning.},

abstract = {Remote Sensing of Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is a research field of growing interest because it offers the potential to quantify actual photosynthesis and to monitor plant status. New satellite missions from the European Space Agency, such as the Earth Explorer 8 FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission—scheduled to launch in 2022 and aiming at SIF mapping—and from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) sampling mission launched in July 2014, provide the capability to estimate SIF from space. The detection of the SIF signal from airborne and satellite platform is difficult and reliable ground level data are needed for calibration/validation. Several commercially available spectroradiometers are currently used to retrieve SIF in the field. This study presents a comparison exercise for evaluating the capability of four spectroradiometers to retrieve SIF. The results show that an accurate far-red SIF estimation can be achieved using spectroradiometers with an ultrafine resolution (less than 1 nm), while the red SIF estimation requires even higher spectral resolution (less than 0.5 nm). Moreover, it is shown that the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) plays a significant role in the precision of the far-red SIF measurements.},

abstract = {Passive detection of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) using spectroscopy has been proposed as a proxy to quantify changes in photochemical efficiency at canopy level under natural light conditions. In this study, we explored the use of imaging spectroscopy to quantify spatio-temporal dynamics of SIF within crop canopies and its sensitivity to track patterns of photosynthetic activity originating from the interaction between vegetation structure and incoming radiation as well as variations in plant function. SIF was retrieved using the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle from imaging spectroscopy data acquired at different time scales a few meters above several crop canopies growing under natural illumination. We report the first maps of canopy SIF in high spatial resolution. Changes of SIF were monitored at different time scales ranging from quick variations under induced stress conditions to seasonal dynamics. Natural changes were primarily determined by varying levels and distribution of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). However, this relationship changed throughout the day demonstrating an additional physiological component modulating spatio-temporal patterns of SIF emission. We successfully used detailed SIF maps to track changes in the canopy's photochemical activity under field conditions, providing a new tool to evaluate complex patterns of photosynthesis within the canopy.

abstract = {Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is an important parameter to explore and quantify carbon fixation by plant ecosystems at various scales. Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique possibility to investigate GPP in a spatially explicit fashion; however, budgeting of terrestrial carbon cycles based on this approach still remains uncertain. To improve calculations, spatio-temporal variability of GPP must be investigated in more detail on local and regional scales. The overarching goal of this study is to enhance our knowledge on how environmentally induced changes of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (LUE) are linked with optical RS parameters. Diurnal courses of sun-induced fluorescence yield (F-Syield) and the photochemical reflectance index of corn were derived from high-resolution spectrometric measurements and their potential as proxies for LUE was investigated. GPP was modeled using Monteith's LUE-concept and optical-based GPP and LUE values were compared with synoptically acquired eddy covariance data. It is shown that the diurnal response of complex physiological regulation of photosynthesis can be tracked reliably with the sun-induced fluorescence. Considering structural and physiological effects, this research shows for the first time that including sun-induced fluorescence into modeling approaches improves their results in predicting diurnal courses of GPP. Our results support the hypothesis that air-or spaceborne quantification of sun-induced fluorescence yield may become a powerful tool to better understand spatio-temporal variations of fluorescence yield, photosynthetic efficiency and plant stress on a global scale.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) has been used for decades to study the organization, functioning, and physiology of photosynthesis at the leaf and subcellular levels. ChlF is now measurable from remote sensing platforms. This provides a new optical means to track photosynthesis and gross primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Importantly, the spatiotemporal and methodological context of the new applications is dramatically different compared with most of the available ChlF literature, which raises a number of important considerations. Although we have a good mechanistic understanding of the processes that control the ChlF signal over the short term, the seasonal link between ChlF and photosynthesis remains obscure. Additionally, while the current understanding of in vivo ChlF is based on pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) measurements, remote sensing applications are based on the measurement of the passive solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which entails important differences and new challenges that remain to be solved. In this review we introduce and revisit the physical, physiological, and methodological factors that control the leaf-level ChlF signal in the context of the new remote sensing applications. Specifically, we present the basis of photosynthetic acclimation and its optical signals, we introduce the physical and physiological basis of ChlF from the molecular to the leaf level and beyond, and we introduce and compare PAM and SIF methodology. Finally, we evaluate and identify the challenges that still remain to be answered in order to consolidate our mechanistic understanding of the remotely sensed SIF signal.},

Practically, the canopy fluorescence yield is approached with yield indexes (as apparent spectral fluorescence yield (ASFY) or fluorescence fraction (FF)) calculated with the top of canopy measured fluxes. By means of canopy fluorescence simulation, this theoretical study purpose to compare the canopy fluorescence yield with these yield indexes calculated from the simulated fluxes for different canopy structures (varying LAI and leaf angle distribution). Results show that, depending on the canopy structure, the indexes can be more or less reliable.

With this perspective, red and blue-green fluorescence emission as measured in the laboratory and field is reviewed.

abstract = {The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) satellite mission, candidate of ESA's 8th Earth Explorer program, is explicitly optimized for detecting the sun-induced fluorescence emitted by plants. It will allow consistent measurements around the O2-B (687nm) and O2-A (760nm) bands, related to the red and far-red fluorescence emission peaks respectively, the photochemical reflectance index, and the structural-chemical state variables of the canopy. The sun-induced fluorescence signal, overlapped to the surface reflected radiance, can be accurately retrieved by employing the powerful spectral fitting technique. In this framework, a set of fluorescence retrieval algorithms optimized for FLEX are proposed in this study. Two main retrieval approaches were investigated: i) the optimization of the spectral fitting for retrieving fluorescence at the oxygen absorption bands; ii) the extension of the spectral fitting to a broader spectral window to retrieve the full fluorescence spectrum in the range from 670 to 780nm. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithms is assessed by employing atmosphere-surface radiative transfer simulations obtained by coupling SCOPE and MODTRAN5 codes. The simulated dataset considers more realistic conditions because it includes directional effects, and the top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra are resampled to the current specifications of the FLuORescence Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) planned to serve as the primary instrument aboard FLEX. The retrieval accuracy obtained at the O2-A band is strongly affected by directional effects, and better performance is found in cases where directional effects are lower. However, the best performing algorithms tested provided similar performance, the RMSE (RRMSE) is 0.044mWm−2sr−1nm−1 (6.2{\%}) at the O2-A band, 0.018mWm−2sr−1nm−1 (2.9{\%}) at the O2-B band, and 6.225mWm−2sr−1 (6.4{\%}) for the spectrally integrated fluorescence emission. The promising results achieved open new perspectives extending fluorescence studies not only in limited absorption bands, but its spectral behavior in relation to different plant species, photosynthetic rates and stress occurrences.},

abstract = {Variations in photosynthesis still cause substantial uncertainties in predicting photosynthetic CO2 uptake rates and monitoring plant stress. Changes in actual photosynthesis that are not related to greenness of vegetation are difficult to measure by reflectance based optical remote sensing techniques. Several activities are underway to evaluate the sun-induced fluorescence signal on the ground and on a coarse spatial scale using space-borne imaging spectrometers. Intermediate-scale observations using airborne-based imaging spectroscopy, which are critical to bridge the existing gap between small-scale field studies and global observations, are still insufficient. Here we present the first validated maps of sun-induced fluorescence in that critical, intermediate spatial resolution, employing the novel airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant. HyPlant has an unprecedented spectral resolution, which allows for the first time quantifying sun-induced fluorescence fluxes in physical units according to the Fraunhofer Line Depth Principle that exploits solar and atmospheric absorption bands. Maps of sun-induced fluorescence show a large spatial variability between different vegetation types, which complement classical remote sensing approaches. Different crop types largely differ in emitting fluorescence that additionally changes within the seasonal cycle and thus may be related to the seasonal activation and deactivation of the photosynthetic machinery. We argue that sun-induced fluorescence emission is related to two processes: (i) the total absorbed radiation by photosynthetically active chlorophyll; and (ii) the functional status of actual photosynthesis and vegetation stress.},

abstract = {This study provides insight into the assessment of the spatio-temporal trends of chlorophyll fluorescence, narrow-band physiological indices, and structural indices acquired with a hyperspectral imager flown over a flux tower in a canopy characterized by small seasonal structural changes and a heterogeneous architecture. A total of seven flights between summer and autumn were conducted with a hyperspectral camera that captured 30cm resolution imagery and 260 spectral bands in the 400-900nm region. This enabled the identification of pure-vegetation tree crown pixels around an eddy covariance flux tower without shadow components or background effects. The hyperspectral imagery was used to study the temporal patterns of canopy fluorescence and reflectance indices related to physiology and canopy structure. The seasonal trends observed in the airborne indices and fluorescence and their relationship with gross primary production (GPP) demonstrated that vegetation indices mostly related to structure such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) yielded non-significant relationships (r2=0.17; p{\textgreater}0.05) due to the small structural changes in the canopy through the season. By contrast, physiological indices related to chlorophyll content (TCARI/OSAVI), light use efficiency (PRI570), and canopy chlorophyll fluorescence calculated through the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle (FLD3) showed a similar seasonal trend to that of GPP measured at the same time of the flights (r2 in the range 0.75–0.84; p{\textless}0.01). These results are consistent with the physiological trend observed during summer and autumn, which showed that chlorophyll content increased by 17.9{\%} while the NDVI and the estimated tree crown projected LAI (LAIp) remained almost constant during the experiment (3{\%} variation). The time-series hyperspectral dataset demonstrated that the seasonal trajectories of the NDVI and EVI were weakly related (p{\textgreater}0.05) to the physiological indicators such as TCARI/OSAVI, PRI570 and fluorescence. The spatial variability of the hyperspectral indices investigated through the coefficient of variation (CV) showed that fluorescence around the tower varied up to 17{\%} at the time of the maximum stress (summer), while LAIp showed little variation during that time (CV=1.8{\%}). After the summer stress period, the CV for fluorescence and chlorophyll content decreased in autumn down to 9{\%}. This study demonstrates that small physiological changes occurring in an evergreen canopy were still captured by remote sensing physiological indices and high-resolution airborne fluorescence. These indicators are required for GPP monitoring when the vegetation dynamics are not captured by remote sensing structural indices.},

abstract = {Mapping of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence from space has shown potential for providing global measurements related to gross primary productivity (GPP). In particular, space-based fluorescence may provide information on the length of the carbon uptake period. Here, for the first time we test the ability of satellite fluorescence retrievals to track seasonal cycle of photosynthesis as estimated from a diverse set of tower gas exchange measurements from around the world. The satellite fluorescence retrievals are obtained using new observations near the 740nm emission feature from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) instrument offering the highest temporal and spatial resolution of available global measurements. Because GOME-2 has a large ground footprint ({\~{}}40×80km2) as compared with that of the flux towers and the GOME-2 data require averaging to reduce random errors, we additionally compare with seasonal cycles of upscaled GPP estimated from a machine learning approach averaged over the same temporal and spatial domain as the satellite data surrounding the tower locations. We also examine the seasonality of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (APAR) estimated from satellite measurements. Finally, to assess whether global vegetation models may benefit from the satellite fluorescence retrievals through validation or additional constraints, we examine seasonal cycles of GPP as produced from an ensemble of vegetation models. Several of the data-driven models rely on satellite reflectance-based vegetation parameters to derive estimates of APAR that are used to compute GPP. For forested (especially deciduous broadleaf and mixed forests) and cropland sites, the GOME-2 fluorescence data track the spring onset and autumn shutoff of photosynthesis as delineated by the upscaled GPP estimates. In contrast, the reflectance-based indicators and many of the models, particularly those driven by data, tend to overestimate the length of the photosynthetically-active period for these biomes. Satellite fluorescence measurements therefore show potential for improving the seasonal dependence of photosynthesis simulated by global models at similar spatial scales.},

This sensor, which operates as a Fraunhofer line discriminator,detects light at the cores of the lines comprising the atmospheric oxygen A and B bands, centered at 762 and 688 nm, respectively. These bands also correspond to wavelengths in the far-red and red chlorophyll fluorescence bands. The sensor is based on an induced fluorescence approach; as light collected from fluorescing plants is passed through a low-pressure cell containing oxygen, the oxygen absorbs the energy and subsequently reemits photons which are then detected by a photomultiplier tube. Since the oxygen in the cell absorbs light at the same wavelengths that have been strongly absorbed by the oxygen in the atmosphere, the response to incident sunlight is minimal. This mode of measurement is limited to target plants sufficiently close in range that the plants' fluorescence is not itself appreciably absorbed by atmospheric oxygen (∼200 m). In vivo measurements of fluorescence in the 760 and 690 nm bands of vegetation in full sunlight are also presented. Measurements of plant fluorescence at the single-plant canopy level were obtained from greenhouse-grown bean plants subjected to a range of nitrogen treatments. The ratio of the fluorescence obtained from the two measurement bands showed statistically significant variation with respect to nitrogen treatments.},

abstract = {The CEFLES2 campaign during the Carbo Eu- rope Regional Experiment Strategy was designed to provide simultaneous airborne measurements of solar induced fluo- rescence and CO2 fluxes. It was combined with extensive ground-based quantification of leaf- and canopy-level pro- cesses in support of ESA's Candidate Earth Explorer Mis- sion of the “Fluorescence Explorer” (FLEX). The aim of this campaign was to test if fluorescence signal detected from an airborne platform can be used to improve estimates of plant mediated exchange on the mesoscale. Canopy fluorescence was quantified from four airborne platforms using a com- bination of novel sensors: (i) the prototype airborne sen- sor AirFLEX quantified fluorescence in the oxygen A and B bands, (ii) a hyperspectral spectrometer (ASD) measured reflectance along transects during 12 day courses, (iii) spa- tially high resolution georeferenced hyperspectral data cubes containing the whole optical spectrum and the thermal re- gion were gathered with an AHS sensor, and (iv) the first employment of the high performance imaging spectrometer HYPER delivered spatially explicit and multi-temporal tran- sects across the whole region. During three measurement periods in April, June and September 2007 structural, func- tional and radiometric characteristics of more than 20 dif- ferent vegetation types in the Les Landes region, Southwest France, were extensively characterized on the ground. The campaign concept focussed especially on quantifying plant mediated exchange processes (photosynthetic electron trans- port,CO2 uptake, evapotranspiration) and fluorescence emis- sion. The comparison between passive sun-induced fluores- cence and active laser-induced fluorescence was performed on a corn canopy in the daily cycle and under desiccation stress. Both techniques show good agreement in detecting stress induced fluorescence change at the 760nm band. On the large scale, airborne and ground-level measurements of fluorescence were compared on several vegetation types sup- porting the scaling of this novel remote sensing signal. The multi-scale design of the four airborne radiometric measure- ments along with extensive ground activities fosters a nested approach to quantify photosynthetic efficiency and gross pri- mary productivity (GPP) from passive fluorescence},

abstract = {This study evaluates the potential of airborne remote sensing images to detect water stress in maize. Visible and near infrared CASI (Itres Research Ltd., Calgary, AL, Canada) and thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) data were acquired at three different times during the day on a maize field (Zea mays L.) grown with three different irrigation treatments. An intensive field campaign was also conducted concurrently with image acquisition to measure leaf ecophysiological parameters and the leaf area index. The analysis of the field data showed that maize plants were experiencing moderate to severe water stress in rainfed plots and a weaker stress condition in the plots with a water deficit imposed between stem elongation and flowering. Vegetation indices including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) computed from the CASI images, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F760) and canopy temperature (Tc) showed different performances in describing the water stress during the day. During the morning overpass, NDVI was the index with the highest discriminant power due to the sensitivity of NDVI to maize canopy structure, affected by the water irrigation treatment. As the day progressed, processes related to heat dissipation through plant transpiration became more and more important and at midday Tc showed the best performances. Furthermore,  Tc retrieved from the midday image was the only index able to distinguish all the three classes of water status. Finally, during the afternoon, PRI and F760 showed the best performances. These results demonstrate the feasibility to detect water stress using thermal and optical airborne data, pointing out the importance of careful planning of the airborne surveys as a function of the specific aims of the study.},

@article{Wieneke2016,
abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) approaches commonly applied to constrain estimates of gross primary production (GPP) employ greenness-based vegetation indices derived from surface reflectance data. Such approaches cannot capture dynamic changes of photosynthesis rates as caused by environmental stress. Further, applied vegetation indices are often affected by background reflectance or saturation effects. Sun. induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) provides the most direct measure of photosynthesis and has been recently proposed as a new RS approach to improve estimates of GPP and tracing plant stress reactions. This work aims to provide further evidence on the complementary information content of F and its relation to changes in photosynthetic activity compared to traditional RS approaches. We use the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant to obtain several F products including red fluorescence (F687), far-red fluorescence (F760), F760 yield (F760yield) and the ration between F687 and F760 (Fratio). We calculate several vegetation indices indicative for vegetation greenness. We apply a recently proposed F-based semi-mechanistic approach to improve the forward modeling of GPP using F760 and compare this approach with a traditional one based on vegetation greenness and ground measurements of GPP derived from chamber measurements. In addition, we assess the sensitivity of F760yield and Fratio for environmental stress. Our results show an improved predictive capability of GPP when using F760 compared to greenness-based vegetation indices. F760yield and Fratio show a strong variability in time and between different crop types suffering from different levels of water shortage, indicating a strong sensitivity of F products for plant stress reactions. We conclude that the new RS approach of F provides complements to the set of commonly applies RS: The use of F760 improves constraining estimates of GPP while the ratio of red and far-red F shows large potential for tracking spatio-temporal plant adaptation in response to environmental stress conditions.},

abstract = {Mapping of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence from space has shown potential for providing global measurements related to gross primary productivity (GPP). In particular, space-based fluorescence may provide information on the length of the carbon uptake period. Here, we show an example of the ability of global satellite fluorescence retrievals to track seasonal cycle of photosynthesis as estimated from tower gas exchange measurements. The satellite fluorescence retrievals are obtained using new observations near the 740 nm emission feature from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) instrument offering the highest temporal and spatial resolution of available global measurements. Because GOME-2 has a large ground footprint ({\~{}}40km by 80km) as compared with that of the flux towers and the GOME-2 data require averaging to reduce random errors, we additionally compare with seasonal cycles of upscaled GPP estimated from a machine learning approach averaged over the same temporal and spatial domain as the satellite data surrounding the tower locations. We also examine the seasonality of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (APAR) estimated from satellite reflectance measurements. Finally, to assess whether global vegetation models may benefit from the satellite fluorescence retrievals through validation or additional constraints, we examine seasonal cycle of GPP at the tower site as produced from an ensemble of vegetation models. The models, particularly those driven by data, tend to overestimate the length of the photosynthetically-active period for this site shown. Satellite fluorescence measurements therefore show potential for improving the seasonal dependence of photosynthesis simulated by global models at similar spatial scales.},

For this purpose, we developed SpectroFLEX, an instrument for quantitative measurements of canopy fluorescence in O2A and O2B atmospheric absorption bands. The fluorescence emission of a natural grass canopy was compared with the leaf level fluorescence spectrum acquired simultaneously. It was found that the red-to-far-red fluorescence ratio decreased by a factor of two from the leaf to the canopy level. In addition, this ratio decreased under high light conditions. FluoSAIL simulations were conducted to study the impact of canopy density and geometry on this decrease. This effect has been attributed to a preferential re-absorption of red fluorescence emission during radiative transfer within the canopy compared to far-red emission.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTRemote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll-a fluorescence (SIF) is a promising method for quantifying photosynthetic activity at the Earth?s surface. Some recent studies therefore aim to clarify to what extend passive SIF measurements can be used to track photosynthetic processes. The present study contributes to that research by investigating the diurnal relationship between short-term variability of SIF and gas exchange rates in terms of stomatal conductance (gs). Quantification of SIF was performed using the Fraunhofer line discriminator (FLD) principle in the O2-A absorption band and by applying a novel approach using the second derivative of the reflectance. Experimental measurements were conducted for two crops, namely winter wheat and maize under stressed and unstressed conditions. Overall, 47 high-spectral-resolution signatures and measurements of gs were collected on three different days during the 2014 growing season. During two days of unstressed conditions, diurnal variability of gs could ? to a large extent (R2 = 0.62 and 0.78) ? be explained by the fraction of SIF in the target radiance flux between 655 and 665 nm (Ffraction). In an experiment with heat and water stress no diurnal relationship appeared between gs and Ffraction, which can be attributed to the occurrence of non-photochemical quenching under stress conditions.},

abstract = {Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is known to relate directly to leaf and canopy scale photosynthesis. Retrieving SIF from space can thus provide an indication on the temporal and spatial patterns of the terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Recent studies have successfully demonstrated the serendipitous retrieval of SIF from satellite remote sensing instruments originally destined to atmospheric studies. However, the finest spatial resolution achieved by these products is 0.5°, which remains too coarse for many applications, including the early detection of drought impacts on vegetation and the integration with ground GPP measurements from flux-towers. This paper proposes a methodology to spatially disaggregate the information contained within each coarse SIF pixels by using a non-linear model based on the concept of light use efficiency (LUE). The strategy involves the aggregation of high-resolution (0.05°) remote sensing biophysical variables to calibrate the downscaling model locally and independently at each time step, which can then be applied to non-aggregated data to create a new layer, denoted SIF*, with a spatial resolution of 0.05°. A global SIF* dataset is generated by applying this methodology globally to 7years of monthly GOME-2 SIF data. SIF* is shown to be a better proxy for GPP than the original coarse spatial resolution product according to flux-tower eddy covariance measurements. Its performance is comparable to dedicated GPP products despite that (unlike SIF*) these are calibrated based on the same flux towers, driven by meteorological data and not hampered by the large noise caused by the SIF retrieval. To further illustrate the added-value of the global SIF* product, this paper also presents: (1) an ecosystem level assessment showing a considerable reduction of noise with respect to the original SIF; (2) a spatio-temporal inter-comparison with existing GPP products; and (3) estimations of global terrestrial productivity per selected vegetation types based on SIF*.},

The FLD method relies on the decoupling of reflected and ChF emitted radiation by the evalu- ation of measurements inside and outside the absorption bands. The improved FLD method introduces two correction coefficients that relate the values of the fluorescence and the reflectance inside and outside the absorption band. The new method uses the full spectral information around the absorption band to derive these coefficients. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to evaluate the impact of the correction coefficients on the accuracy of the ChF estimation.

abstract = {Interest in remote sensing (RS) of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) by terrestrial vegetation is motivated by the link of F to photosynthetic efficiency which could be exploited for large scale monitoring of plant status and functioning. Today, passive RS of F is feasible with different prototypes and commercial ground-based, airborne, and even spaceborne instruments under certain conditions. This interest is generating an increasing number of research projects linking F and RS, such as the development of new F remote retrieval techniques, the understanding of the link between the F signal and vegetation physiology and the feasibility of a satellite mission specifically designed for F monitoring. This paper reviews the main issues to be addressed for estimating F from RS observations. Scattered information about F estimation exists in the literature. Here, more than 40 scientific papers dealing with F estimation are reviewed and major differences are found in approaches, instruments and experimental setups. Different approaches are grouped into major categories according to RS data requirements (i.e. radiance or reflectance, multispectral or hyperspectral) and techniques used to extract F from the remote signal. Theoretical assumptions, advantages and drawbacks of each method are outlined and provide perspectives for future research. Finally, applications of the measured F signal at the three scales of observation (ground, aircraft and satellite) are presented and discussed to provide the state of the art in F estimation.},
